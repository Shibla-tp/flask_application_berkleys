Looking at my parents giving up everything they had in Vietnam and coming here just for me to have better future, I know that I have to make them proud. I made a promise to myself I have to retire my parents as fast as I can so that they can enjoy their life at most. 

Fortunately, I was invited to a business opportunity where I got a chance to surround myself with successful people. I got to meet my mentors and coaches, who look at me as a successful leader just like them. I luckily earned their respect and observed their mindset to develop myself. They helped me changing my mindset, thinking as an enterpreneur, working hard in a smart way. Thanks to them, I have become a better me who always full of positivity and love. And now, I want to help other people, together, becoming a better version of ourselves.

My passion lies in making data more approachable and fun, and I often use unconventional methods to do so - with music, humor or other creative outlets.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/carminedisibio/,carmine.disibio@ey.com,"I am the Global Chairman and CEO for EY, one of the largest professional services organizations in the world, which in the last fiscal year achieved US$45 billion in revenues and today has approximately 400,000 people serving clients in more than 150 countries worldwide.

Prior to being elected to my current post, I served as EY Global Managing Partner – Client Service, leading the execution of the organization's global strategy and its four geographical areas and four service lines.

In 2019, I led the development of EY’s global strategy, NextWave, which expands on the purpose of 'Building a better working world' and has a clear ambition to create long-term value for all stakeholders. To execute the NextWave strategy, in 2021 EY announced investments of US$10b in EY people and technology.  
  
I helped to create the Global Innovation team to redefine how EY uses technology to both transform existing services and create new solutions. Prior to that, I held several global operating and leadership positions at EY, using my extensive experience in financial services. My global experience has equipped me with a keen understanding of cultures and clients around the world, and I am a strong advocate for the power of EY’s global organization.  

Since joining EY in 1985, I served as an Advisory and Assurance partner for many of our largest financial services accounts. Over the course of my career, I held several leadership positions at EY, including Chair of the Global Financial Services Markets Executive and Regional Managing Partner for the Americas Financial Services Organization (FSO), where I started EY Risk Management and Regulatory Services.

I’m originally from Italy and emigrated with my family to the United States when I was three years old. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, earning a BA in Chemistry from Colgate University, and an MBA from New York University’s Stern School of Business. 

I also serve on the boards of the Foundation for Empowering Citizens with Autism and Family Promise. I’m also a member of the Board of Trustees of Colgate University and the Wake Forest University Business School Board of Visitors.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-savino-1a04869/,Unknown,"Ho iniziato la mia carriera dopo un percorso di studi umanistico all’Università degli Studi di Milano. Dopo una prima esperienza nella direzione HR di stabilimento, sono entrata in consulenza dove sono rimasta per quasi 5 anni, occupandomi di temi organizzativi e di sviluppo, oltre che di ricerca e selezione per profili di medio e top management.
 
Nel 2000 ho incontrato Aubay – all’epoca una start up del mondo ICT – e sono entrata con l’ambizione di creare tutte le metriche della funzione HR.

Ho vissuto in questi 20 anni l’energia e l’entusiasmo di una crescita importante dell’azienda, realizzata con tanta attività di sviluppo e cinque acquisizioni di società del nostro mercato.

Ogni passaggio ha segnato la nascita di una Aubay diversa, da (ri)costruire, e la necessità di armonizzare tutti gli equilibri – nuovi e precedenti –  con la responsabilità di restituire a tutte le identità il giusto valore, pur nell’inevitabile unicum di cui le aziende si devono fare sintesi. 

Credo sia questo il valore più profondo che cerco di trasmettere in tutti i processi che vedono coinvolta la mia funzione.

Attualmente, sono supportata da 6 colleghe che presidiano le diverse attività HR, ognuna con il suo team. Credo di aver costruito una squadra di è persone che si capiscono e si aiutano, lontana da qualunque dinamica di competizione negativa.

Aubay ha rappresentato la mia crescita. Ogni passaggio ha richiesto anche a me l’impegno e la capacità di diventare una professionista diversa.

Mi sento però di poter dire che ogni riflessione, suggerimento o richiesta da parte di uno qualsiasi dei nostri 2000 colleghi sia sempre stata almeno letta o sentita da me, perché credo che la mia funzione abbia senso solo come sintesi dei valori e delle esigenze di chi la “anima”.

Io la chiamo “cittadinanza organizzativa” – cioè il diritto che è dato a tutti, all’interno della nostra organizzazione, di poter dare le proprie opinioni ed essere presi in considerazione.",💼 Vice President & Human Resources Director di Aubay Italia | 👩🏼‍💼 Gestisco persone armonizzando valori ed esigenze | 🗣️ Parlo di impresa generativa e futuro del lavoro,"Milan, Lombardy, Italy",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQELdoh1JhZyhA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1667838364202?e=1737590400&v=beta&t=m63y5VX3kkARHBD0rzdABGidutJ-IoJepi3R8FW-Xuk,Marta,Savino,Marta Savino,3rd,ACoAAAGr8YgBOaHKY5LuVz2XCi-xmwG2R6IE284,28045704,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAGr8YgBOaHKY5LuVz2XCi-xmwG2R6IE284,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAGr8YgBOaHKY5LuVz2XCi-xmwG2R6IE284%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAGr8YgBOaHKY5LuVz2XCi-xmwG2R6IE284%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,Unknown,Aubay Italia,2009-01-01,Università Statale di Milano,Unknown,Università Statale di milano,https://www.aubay.it/,Human Resources,2024-11-19T14:43:56.519Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/aubay-italy/,2024-11-22T07:24:01.000Z,Unknown,1001-5000,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marta-savino-1a04869/_Unknown,Italy

With more than 20M+ followers across all platforms, we’ve been able to create an incredible community. If you are a fan – thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your support over the years. I’m consistently speechless with how incredible the ride has been.

For more than a decade, I’ve been perfecting my craft, growing my audience, and winning. There have been a lot of long nights and a lot of struggles along the way. And I know there are others out there too that are in the same boat. There are so many great content creators out there, I want to do my part in shining the light on some of the best. 

In 2020, we launched Oni Studios to give back and serve as an extension of my previous education commentary streams. Some of my most popular videos have been around my educational gameplay on Fortnite, where I tried to focus on teaching strategies, tips and tricks, and general coaching & mentorship. At their core, I was always trying to help people speed run through the years of trial and error that I went through learning Fortnite, and to gain the confidence they need to keep going whether in streaming or in life. 

Oni Studio is the next evolution of the stream and is built on a mission to give back and empower the next generation of content creators. In the past, we’ve helped bring unknown gamers to the forefront and help them to build their brands from the ground up. With Oni Studio’s upcoming 30,000 sq ft HQ, we’ll be continuing that at a scale not thought possible.  We’ll be hosting a variety of events, activations, productions, and much more!

I have worked with some awesome brands in the past like PacSun, Ralph Lauren, State Farm, and Lenovo  to spark engagement, get in front of a rapidly growing audience, and deliver some unforgettable content.
My team and I are always interested in working with and growing with potential collaborators or partners.

Words which always inspires me :

                  ''When you stop learning, you stop leading''

I'm a lifelong learner- I keep on learning whether formally in a direct manner or indirectly from people, 
 publications, work etc.

As I passed my chartered accountancy exam and acquired a few more degrees along the way, I realised being a CA is a great honour and an immense responsibility. My Journey of working in a vast range of roles for a variety of companies has given me an understanding of running big organisations and also an opportunity to lead them to phenomenal growth .I've also been part of many professional bodies and business groups.

As His Highness 'Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid' says,

'In the race of excellence there is no finishing line'

Therefore my goal is to keep on achieving excellence in my work and in my commitment to the federntiy.

We are the home of popular entertainment and digital consumer brands. We reach millions of people day to day and use this wide reach to build young companies into successful brands – all this with the objective to create long-term value for our shareholders. Together with around 8,000 colleagues, I work as Group CEO of ProSiebenSat.1 to drive our transformation into a digital group day by day. I have been the Group’s CEO since January 1, 2022. Prior to that, I was Chairman of the Executive Board and Group Chief Financial Officer as of March 26, 2020. I joined the company as Chief Financial Officer in July 2019. 
With my 20+year-experience as CEO and CFO of listed companies and an extremely analytical and implementation-oriented mind-set, I am always focusing on developing companies through both value-adding M&A transactions and strong organic growth, while building efficient structures and processes. 

Prior to joining ProSiebenSat.1, I was working for the listed packaging manufacturer Gerresheimer where I was CFO for over seven years and responsible for important transforming M&A transactions like Sensile Medical and Centor. During this time, I also took over the Life Science Research business unit until it was sold in 2016. For seven months, I was also Speaker of the Board of Management of the packaging specialist. 

Previously, I was Managing Director and CFO of Elster Group, the world's largest manufacturer of measurement and control technology, and CFO of crane manufacturer Demag Cranes. There, I was also responsible for global purchasing and for refinancing the company. During this time, I led the company from the SDax to the MDax.

During my more than ten years with Deutsche Telekom / T-Online, I was CEO of the Internet provider T-Online from 2004 until its merger with Deutsche Telekom in 2006. Previously, I already headed the company's finance department as CFO. In this time, we especially focused on the internationalization of T-Online, which at the time was the largest TecDax stock with a market capitalization of around EUR 10 billion.",Former Group CEO ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE,"Meerbusch, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQEDX1dfwonCTA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1667218269282?e=1737590400&v=beta&t=NqJiOMNdnuQ5daUFtltrYBFxdbpyeNa0khANtM8VG7c,Rainer,Beaujean,Rainer Beaujean,3rd,ACoAAC6RvwgBtVZPZxNBDmLEkDQoBFOko5yrtA0,781303560,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAC6RvwgBtVZPZxNBDmLEkDQoBFOko5yrtA0,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAC6RvwgBtVZPZxNBDmLEkDQoBFOko5yrtA0%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAC6RvwgBtVZPZxNBDmLEkDQoBFOko5yrtA0%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,+4921150526562,Rheinische Post Mediengruppe,2020-01-01,Universität Bielefeld,Unknown,Unknown,https://www.rheinischepostmediengruppe.de,Unknown,2024-11-22T06:13:08.298Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rheinische-post-mediengruppe/,2024-11-22T06:14:55.000Z,Unknown,1001-5000,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rainer-beaujean/_Unknown,Germany

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiewearetrampoline/,sophie@wearetrampoline.fr,"👋 Hi LinkedIn, I'm Sophie - an SDR recruiter and sales coach.

I have worked in SDR Recruitment for 12-years and in that time I have helped over 500 SaaS companies hire emerging talent and have placed and trained 3,000 + SDRs. I am a little proud that I have won a few recruitment awards over the years too.🏆

In 2023 I had a baby and decided to take the leap myself and start my own business, Trampoline. 

💜 Trampoline is a European Talent Agency that is helping SaaS Companies hire and upskill emerging talent for Sales Development Representative roles. 

Trampoline is founded on my beliefs that the SDR role is the best launch pad into a commercial career for a candidate and is the most important part of a company's GTM strategy - especially in the early stages. I am a big fan of cold calling and social selling and I strongly believe that outbound prospecting will always be better with a human touch.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hermelin/,paul.hermelin@capgemini.com,"In 2002 Serge Kampf, founder of Capgemini and the Board of Directors, handed me the reins of the Group and for 18 years I was CEO of this remarkable organization. In 2012 my responsibilities grew as I also became Chairman. On May 20, 2020, following our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Aiman Ezzat took on the role of CEO at Capgemini. I now still remain Chairman of the Board.

I joined the Capgemini Group in 1993, after fifteen years working in the French government, primarily in the ministry of Finance, where I held a number of posts in the Budget Office and on various ministry staffs, including that of Finance Minister Jacques Delors. Before joining Capgemini Group, I was chief of staff to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Minister of Industry and Trade, from 1991 to 1993.

Initially overseeing central functions at Capgemini Group, I became CEO of Cap Gemini France in 1996, taking a seat on Cap Gemini’s Directoire in May 1996. I was then named deputy CEO of the Group and Board member in May 2000 after initiating the merger of Capgemini and Ernst & Young Consulting. I was appointed CEO of the Capgemini Group in 2002, after the Board of Directors accepted Serge Kampf’s proposal, and then also took on the additional role of Chairman of the Capgemini Group in May 2012. 

Outside of Capgemini, as part of the emphasis on economic diplomacy, Laurent Fabius, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, appointed me in January 2013 as Special Representative for the economic relationship with India.

I am also Chairman of THE BRIDGE SAS, incubator of startups and corporate open innovation based at Avignon (France) promoting French Tech Culture Avignon Provence. And I was appointed Chairman of the Opera Festival of Aix-en-Provence in June 2018. 

I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in 1972 and the Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA) in 1978.",Chairman Of The Board at Capgemini,"Paris, Île-de-France, France",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQHwhjCe6cjjXw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1539789473160?e=1737590400&v=beta&t=E-6YjX-dNKsF9T9Uam58ppH4EYFDsTNNtoR3Zir3LYQ,Paul,Hermelin,Paul Hermelin,2nd,ACoAACkSvjUB1O6HRV2hORsXMJS-338v75ItXU0,689094197,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAACkSvjUB1O6HRV2hORsXMJS-338v75ItXU0,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACkSvjUB1O6HRV2hORsXMJS-338v75ItXU0%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACkSvjUB1O6HRV2hORsXMJS-338v75ItXU0%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,Unknown,Capgemini,2020-05-01,ENA - Ecole nationale d'administration,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1776949/,Économie,https://www.capgemini.com,"Start-up, Mentorat, Gestion du changement, Anglais, Stratégie",2024-11-19T14:45:54.045Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/capgemini/,2024-11-22T07:24:01.000Z,Unknown,10001,https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hermelin/_paul.hermelin@capgemini.com,France

https://www.linkedin.com/in/asmabajawa/,asma@peoplefirstme.com,"Born and bred in the UK, I started my career with British Airways where I spent 22 years working in different aspects of the business but predominately in HR & Training and Development. 15 years ago, I moved to UAE where I held a number of senior HR Directorship roles before setting up PeopleFirst. Since then I have spearheaded the company to become one of the leading HR consultancies in the region.

Prior to setting up PeopleFirst I was the HR Director for du where I successfully led the launch of the company from an HR perspective. I then went on to work for Abu Dhabi Airports Company as the Principal Consultant working directly with the Board to right size the company from 1200 to 650 employees as it transitioned from being a Government entity to a joint stock semi private company.

My business acumen, enthusiasm and ability to understand and work successfully with different cultures has helped me build a strong reputation across the region.

Before Jabba Brands, Solomon founded and sold two successful F&B companies: 16 Handles, New York City's first self-serve frozen yogurt shop that grew to over 40 locations internationally, and Greeno Products, a supplier of custom and off-the-shelf disposables for the food service industry. Both companies were bootstrapped for almost 15 years each, without outside investment, and generated 8-figure and 7-figure revenues respectively. Solomon has also invested in and advised multiple F&B-related companies and startups, such as Lunchbox, Sanzo, and Kolkata Chai Co., helping them scale to become best-in-class brands.

Solomon's core competencies include franchising, go-to-market strategy, restaurant technology, and bootstrapped growth. He holds a BS in Business Administration from USC Marshall School of Business and certifications in Restaurant Revenue Management and Digital Marketing from eCornell. He speaks English, Korean, and has a Beginner's Mandarin certification from Tsinghua University. Solomon enjoys speaking to students, entrepreneurs, and organizations, and sharing his insights and expertise on F&B and entrepreneurship. His mission is to build leading F&B brands that people love and positively impact the world.","CEO @ Jabba Brands | Growth consulting and advisory for restaurant concepts, CPG, and restaurant technology companies",New York City Metropolitan Area,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5603AQH7Ht372aK7WQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1598456957686?e=1737590400&v=beta&t=XfU5FiZ8XsKXC40eY_qFL2nZya-qvcD49NGdxwFzook,Solomon,Choi,Solomon Choi,3rd,ACoAAABv10UBe349jPz-Y_-tqyUCWjXcPvQZn6o,7329605,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAABv10UBe349jPz-Y_-tqyUCWjXcPvQZn6o,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAABv10UBe349jPz-Y_-tqyUCWjXcPvQZn6o%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAABv10UBe349jPz-Y_-tqyUCWjXcPvQZn6o%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,Unknown,Jabba Brands,2019-02-01,USC Marshall School of Business,https://www.linkedin.com/company/3083/,"BS, Business Administration",https://www.jabbabrands.com,"Startups, Angel Investing, Fundraising, Advisory Boards, Restaurant Technology, Franchise Management, Franchise Sales, Restaurant Marketing, Vendor Management, Restaurant Operations, Operations Management, Customer Service Management, Training & Development, Hospitality Management, New Restaurant Openings, Lean Startup, Microsoft PowerPoint, Go-to-Market Strategy, Technology, Food Service, Branding, QSR, Branding & Identity Marketing, Management, Leadership, Strategic Planning, Public Speaking",2024-11-19T21:45:07.698Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jabba-brands/,2024-11-22T07:24:01.000Z,Unknown,2-10,https://www.linkedin.com/in/solomonchoi/_solomon@jabbabrands.com,Unknown

- In 2023, Vay became the first and is still today the only company to be fully driverless on public streets in Europe (Hamburg) 
- In May 2023, Thomas von der Ohe, the CEO and Co-Founder of Vay was awarded as founder of the year 2023 from the German start-up federation. Previous year winner: Jochen Engert from Flixbus. Keynote speech: Chancellor Olaf Scholz

About Vay:
- Vay pursues a different approach towards driverless mobility: remote driving (aka ""teledriving"")
- We want to bring forward green, sustainable transportation to achieve a positive impact on societies across the globe. From Europe.
- Our first application: 1. You click a button in the VayApp; 2. A teledriver brings you an electric car within a few minutes; 3. You drive it to your final destination and leave the car; 4. No need to park it as another teledriver takes care of that
- We aim to introduce autonomous functions in our system gradually and based on high-quality teledrive data
- Vay’s 150+ team members have previously worked at companies such as Tesla, Google, Waymo, Zoox, Amazon, Uber as well as Audi, BMW, and Daimler. 
- Funded with $100+M to date, Vay became the highest funded European startup in the self-driving car industry with its Series B
- For more information: www.vay.io


Before Vay:
Together with great teams, I've shipped our own dynamic carpool solution, the 1st Amazon Echo, the 1st Amazon Tap and the 1st public road testing for a self driving car at Zoox in the Silicon Valley. 
I hold a M.Sc. in MS&E with focus on Computer Science & Entrepreneurship from Stanford University.

In this role, I was an extension of (and advisor to) over 300+ security programs across many industry verticals. Under my direction, my team triaged over 22,000 vulnerabilities in 2018-2019 alone. 

Personally, I love being in the trenches and performing actual assessments, but I am also adept at handling clients, architecting solutions, designing services, improving business processes, managing technical consultants, training, technical writing, marketing, and delivering solutions. 

While my strengths are web, network/infrastructural, and mobile security, I have personally performed a myriad of other services and implemented them for a consultancy as a deliverable (mainframe, wireless, cloud assessment, database, OSINT, APT simulation, binary reversing, and static code analysis).

In my free time, I write for several information security publications and am a semi-regular capture-the-flag player. I speak regularly at security conferences globally (DEFCON, Blackhat, OWASP, and many more)

While I never call myself a ""master"" of anything, I do have a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. These skills make me adept at helping businesses, finding security vulnerabilities, and leading a business to a better security posture.",CEO | Hacker | Trainer at Arcanum Information Security,"Aurora, Colorado, United States",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQHiXVmVzgdDkw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1712176257763?e=1737590400&v=beta&t=Wm9vnxa7Z7f1TVDwpYlwkDE1N1w43VmIA87RXPZ2CvI,Jason,Haddix,Jason Haddix,2nd,ACoAAAMWKe8BoXl5JZUAden7Q3BjgrIqh8Gr1v4,51784175,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAMWKe8BoXl5JZUAden7Q3BjgrIqh8Gr1v4,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAMWKe8BoXl5JZUAden7Q3BjgrIqh8Gr1v4%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAMWKe8BoXl5JZUAden7Q3BjgrIqh8Gr1v4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,Unknown,Arcanum Information Security,2024-01-01,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,https://www.arcanum-sec.com,"Penetration Testing, Hacking, Web Application Security, Auditing, Training Delivery, Hands-on Training, Information Security, Information Assurance, Mobile Security, Online Journalism, Methodology Implementation, Mobile Applications, Infrastructure Security, Marketing Strategy, Network Security, Computer Security, Security Audits, Security Research, Vulnerability Assessment, Vulnerability Management, Security, Linux, IPS",2024-11-20T12:30:03.949Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/arcanum-information-security/,2024-11-22T07:24:01.000Z,July 27,2-10,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhaddix/_jhaddix@arcanum-sec.com,United States

The all-electric Lilium Jet combines the flexibility of a VTOL aircraft with the efficiency of a traditional fixed-wing aircraft, resulting in industry-leading maximum range and speed. 

Thanks to our ducted fan technology, flying with a Lilium Jet will be fast, comfortable, CO2-emissons free and quiet.   

What started as an idea by 4 students at the Technical University of Munich in 2015 has grown into a NASDAQ-listed, EASA DOA-certified company with over 1000 employees, including more than 500 aerospace engineers and a leadership team responsible for delivering some of the most successful aircraft in aviation history.    

During my time as CEO, I had the opportunity to lead the company to several key milestones, including the first flight of our technology demonstrator in 2019, multiple rounds of fundraising leading up to the company's IPO in 2021, and building a strong, dedicated team of industry leaders.  

In 2022, I handed over the CEO role to Klaus Roewe, who brings with him more than 30 years of experience at Airbus, where he was responsible for the A320neo development, the A320 program and global Customer Service.

Working in Dubai for more than 15 years, frequently travelling across middle east and having lead a team of Arab nationals gave me good understanding of multi cultures .
I have a very close network with the Indian business and social community in general and the Indian pharmacists in particular as the Founder member and former President of Indian Pharmacist Welfare Council working under the Indian Consulate, Dubai as well as former President and Gen.

I founded Presize (exit to Meta in April 2022), which you might know from ""Die Höhle der Löwen"" (German version of shark tank). It's a startup in the AI / Computer Vision space recommending users the right clothing size when shopping online. 

In 2022, Presize was acquired by Meta (Facebook/Instagram) where we continued on our mission to scale our AI size recommendation technology to 4bn users.

As a Product Manager at Meta I am working on one of the biggest product catalogs in the world which powers a variety of ecommerce use cases from ads to Facebook Shops & Instagram Shopping (rolled out in the US).

I have an academic background in Human-Computer Interaction research (LMU, Stanford, CDTM & Cambridge) and graduated as valedictorian from TUM (MSc).

https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavinpatel2022/,bhavin@lendenclub.com,"True to my roots of being a quintessential Gujarati, I am positively stereotypical in my entrepreneurial approach. I co-founded LenDenClub in 2015 with a vision of having an enhanced investor experience. Despite not being blessed with top B-school credentials and experience from the big giants, I am a go-getter, bullish, very desi, ROI minded and like to understand the consumers by the pulse.

I brought P2P in India and I didn't believe in running after seed funding - I first built the base and only then approached for seed funding. There is no success with shortcuts and this belief of mine makes me an advocate of hard work, discipline and integrity.

Discipline comes from my sports background and love for sports - an avid football player and has in fact found my LenDenClub co-founder through football itself - Dipesh, with whom I played and still play football. This culture of football has thus been instilled amongst every LenDenite through a positive reinforcement of participation every Thursday post work. I religiously play football every Sunday with my circle at 4 in the morning.

I am passionate about what I do, whether it's work, football, fitness or love for mobiles & cars. Hierarchy is never a yardstick for me and l prefer being emphatic and equal in my day-to-day interactions with team members whether a GET/MT or my Co-Founder.

I've learnt from my experiences immensely, far more than what books could've taught me. And it's only fair to pass on what you get. My ambition is not just to be a successful entrepreneur but I yearn to be a contributor to the nation by disrupting the FinTech space.","CEO, LenDenClub Platforms","Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQHPUC413AyR5g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1724935616557?e=1738195200&v=beta&t=hSFAGynh14FjkjF8m9_1Ec31ZRf6AjbyF1AUdgaR4UU,Bhavin,Patel,Bhavin Patel,2nd,ACoAAAG1yasBBW7QL2iWlLF73YQ4x9wOB3t7VDA,28690859,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAG1yasBBW7QL2iWlLF73YQ4x9wOB3t7VDA,name",https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAG1yasBBW7QL2iWlLF73YQ4x9wOB3t7VDA%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAG1yasBBW7QL2iWlLF73YQ4x9wOB3t7VDA%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,Unknown,LenDenClub,2014-09-01,Kirloskar Institute of Management (KIM),https://www.linkedin.com/company/15099251/,"PGDM, Marketing & Finance",http://www.lendenclub.com,"Corporate Finance, Structured Finance, Finance, Banking, Capital Markets, Securitization, Business Planning, Business Development, Investment Banking, Debt, MIS, Financial Structuring, Start-ups, Negotiation, Funding, Deal Structuring, Structuring, Strategic Planning, Early-stage Startups, Team Management, Management, Business Strategy",2024-11-27T04:22:56.485Z,https://www.linkedin.com/company/lenden-club/,2024-11-27T04:23:09.000Z,Unknown,Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavinpatel2022/_bhavin@lendenclub.com,India
