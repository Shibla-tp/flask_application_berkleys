Looking at my parents giving up everything they had in Vietnam and coming here just for me to have better future, I know that I have to make them proud. I made a promise to myself I have to retire my parents as fast as I can so that they can enjoy their life at most. 

Fortunately, I was invited to a business opportunity where I got a chance to surround myself with successful people. I got to meet my mentors and coaches, who look at me as a successful leader just like them. I luckily earned their respect and observed their mindset to develop myself. They helped me changing my mindset, thinking as an enterpreneur, working hard in a smart way. Thanks to them, I have become a better me who always full of positivity and love. And now, I want to help other people, together, becoming a better version of ourselves.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/carminedisibio/,carmine.disibio@ey.com,"I am the Global Chairman and CEO for EY, one of the largest professional services organizations in the world, which in the last fiscal year achieved US$45 billion in revenues and today has approximately 400,000 people serving clients in more than 150 countries worldwide.

Prior to being elected to my current post, I served as EY Global Managing Partner – Client Service, leading the execution of the organization's global strategy and its four geographical areas and four service lines.

In 2019, I led the development of EY’s global strategy, NextWave, which expands on the purpose of 'Building a better working world' and has a clear ambition to create long-term value for all stakeholders. To execute the NextWave strategy, in 2021 EY announced investments of US$10b in EY people and technology.  
  
I helped to create the Global Innovation team to redefine how EY uses technology to both transform existing services and create new solutions. Prior to that, I held several global operating and leadership positions at EY, using my extensive experience in financial services. My global experience has equipped me with a keen understanding of cultures and clients around the world, and I am a strong advocate for the power of EY’s global organization.  

Since joining EY in 1985, I served as an Advisory and Assurance partner for many of our largest financial services accounts. Over the course of my career, I held several leadership positions at EY, including Chair of the Global Financial Services Markets Executive and Regional Managing Partner for the Americas Financial Services Organization (FSO), where I started EY Risk Management and Regulatory Services.

I’m originally from Italy and emigrated with my family to the United States when I was three years old. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, earning a BA in Chemistry from Colgate University, and an MBA from New York University’s Stern School of Business. 

I also serve on the boards of the Foundation for Empowering Citizens with Autism and Family Promise. I’m also a member of the Board of Trustees of Colgate University and the Wake Forest University Business School Board of Visitors.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sypherpk/,ali@onistudios.gg,"Hey what's up guys, it's Sypher! I’m a professional gamer, streamer, YouTuber, and online personality based out of Austin, Texas. With more than 20M+ followers across all platforms, we’ve been able to create an incredible community. If you are a fan – thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your support over the years. I’m consistently speechless with how incredible the ride has been.

For more than a decade, I’ve been perfecting my craft, growing my audience, and winning. There have been a lot of long nights and a lot of struggles along the way. And I know there are others out there too that are in the same boat. There are so many great content creators out there, I want to do my part in shining the light on some of the best. 

In 2020, we launched Oni Studios to give back and serve as an extension of my previous education commentary streams. Some of my most popular videos have been around my educational gameplay on Fortnite, where I tried to focus on teaching strategies, tips and tricks, and general coaching & mentorship. At their core, I was always trying to help people speed run through the years of trial and error that I went through learning Fortnite, and to gain the confidence they need to keep going whether in streaming or in life. 

Oni Studio is the next evolution of the stream and is built on a mission to give back and empower the next generation of content creators. In the past, we’ve helped bring unknown gamers to the forefront and help them to build their brands from the ground up. With Oni Studio’s upcoming 30,000 sq ft HQ, we’ll be continuing that at a scale not thought possible.  We’ll be hosting a variety of events, activations, productions, and much more!

I have worked with some awesome brands in the past like PacSun, Ralph Lauren, State Farm, and Lenovo  to spark engagement, get in front of a rapidly growing audience, and deliver some unforgettable content.
My team and I are always interested in working with and growing with potential collaborators or partners.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiewearetrampoline/,sophie@wearetrampoline.fr,"👋 Hi LinkedIn, I'm Sophie - an SDR recruiter and sales coach.

I have worked in SDR Recruitment for 12-years and in that time I have helped over 500 SaaS companies hire emerging talent and have placed and trained 3,000 + SDRs. I am a little proud that I have won a few recruitment awards over the years too.🏆

In 2023 I had a baby and decided to take the leap myself and start my own business, Trampoline. 

💜 Trampoline is a European Talent Agency that is helping SaaS Companies hire and upskill emerging talent for Sales Development Representative roles. 

Trampoline is founded on my beliefs that the SDR role is the best launch pad into a commercial career for a candidate and is the most important part of a company's GTM strategy - especially in the early stages. I am a big fan of cold calling and social selling and I strongly believe that outbound prospecting will always be better with a human touch. 

✌️If you want to have a chat about how Trampoline could help you hire and train SDR talent then please get in touch

In 2012 my responsibilities grew as I also became Chairman. On May 20, 2020, following our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Aiman Ezzat took on the role of CEO at Capgemini. I now still remain Chairman of the Board.

I joined the Capgemini Group in 1993, after fifteen years working in the French government, primarily in the ministry of Finance, where I held a number of posts in the Budget Office and on various ministry staffs, including that of Finance Minister Jacques Delors. Before joining Capgemini Group, I was chief of staff to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Minister of Industry and Trade, from 1991 to 1993.

Initially overseeing central functions at Capgemini Group, I became CEO of Cap Gemini France in 1996, taking a seat on Cap Gemini’s Directoire in May 1996. I was then named deputy CEO of the Group and Board member in May 2000 after initiating the merger of Capgemini and Ernst & Young Consulting. I was appointed CEO of the Capgemini Group in 2002, after the Board of Directors accepted Serge Kampf’s proposal, and then also took on the additional role of Chairman of the Capgemini Group in May 2012. 

Outside of Capgemini, as part of the emphasis on economic diplomacy, Laurent Fabius, French Minister of Foreign Affairs, appointed me in January 2013 as Special Representative for the economic relationship with India.

I am also Chairman of THE BRIDGE SAS, incubator of startups and corporate open innovation based at Avignon (France) promoting French Tech Culture Avignon Provence. And I was appointed Chairman of the Opera Festival of Aix-en-Provence in June 2018.

- In 2024, Vay launched its ""fully driverless"" (no safety driver nor safety operator) commercial service in US (Las Vegas) 
- In 2023, Vay became the first and is still today the only company to be fully driverless on public streets in Europe (Hamburg) 
- In May 2023, Thomas von der Ohe, the CEO and Co-Founder of Vay was awarded as founder of the year 2023 from the German start-up federation. Previous year winner: Jochen Engert from Flixbus. Keynote speech: Chancellor Olaf Scholz

About Vay:
- Vay pursues a different approach towards driverless mobility: remote driving (aka ""teledriving"")
- We want to bring forward green, sustainable transportation to achieve a positive impact on societies across the globe. From Europe.
- Our first application: 1. You click a button in the VayApp; 2. A teledriver brings you an electric car within a few minutes; 3. You drive it to your final destination and leave the car; 4. No need to park it as another teledriver takes care of that
- We aim to introduce autonomous functions in our system gradually and based on high-quality teledrive data
- Vay’s 150+ team members have previously worked at companies such as Tesla, Google, Waymo, Zoox, Amazon, Uber as well as Audi, BMW, and Daimler. 
- Funded with $100+M to date, Vay became the highest funded European startup in the self-driving car industry with its Series B
- For more information: www.vay.io


Before Vay:
Together with great teams, I've shipped our own dynamic carpool solution, the 1st Amazon Echo, the 1st Amazon Tap and the 1st public road testing for a self driving car at Zoox in the Silicon Valley. 
I hold a M.Sc. in MS&E with focus on Computer Science & Entrepreneurship from Stanford University.

In my previous roles such as Director of Penetration Testing, I led efforts on matters of information security consulting. The gamut stretched from developing penetration testing plans for Fortune 100 companies to competing in ""bake-offs"" to win business against other top-tier consulting vendors. 

I have also served as a Director of Operations, leading teams of highly technical Application Security Engineers and Technical Operations staff. In this role, I was an extension of (and advisor to) over 300+ security programs across many industry verticals. Under my direction, my team triaged over 22,000 vulnerabilities in 2018-2019 alone. 

Personally, I love being in the trenches and performing actual assessments, but I am also adept at handling clients, architecting solutions, designing services, improving business processes, managing technical consultants, training, technical writing, marketing, and delivering solutions. 

While my strengths are web, network/infrastructural, and mobile security, I have personally performed a myriad of other services and implemented them for a consultancy as a deliverable (mainframe, wireless, cloud assessment, database, OSINT, APT simulation, binary reversing, and static code analysis).

In my free time, I write for several information security publications and am a semi-regular capture-the-flag player. I speak regularly at security conferences globally (DEFCON, Blackhat, OWASP, and many more)

During my time as CEO, I had the opportunity to lead the company to several key milestones, including the first flight of our technology demonstrator in 2019, multiple rounds of fundraising leading up to the company's IPO in 2021, and building a strong, dedicated team of industry leaders.  

In 2022, I handed over the CEO role to Klaus Roewe, who brings with him more than 30 years of experience at Airbus, where he was responsible for the A320neo development, the A320 program and global Customer Service.
